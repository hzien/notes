when you create a new directory:
	1. ls (for a list of all the folders in the directory you are currently - in this case it is "notes")
	2. cd means "change directory" so if you typed "cd downloads" it would open you "downoalds" folder
	3.mkdir is "make directory" because you are making a new folder in your finder on your computer 
	4. cd ~ will alwys equal my home directory meaning "hannazien" 

	option, command and #'s 1-5 will split the screen you are working on (in sublime text)

	everything you want to go to the "cloud" needs to start with "git"
